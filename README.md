```

## How to run experiments
1. setup python environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. to install StarCraft II & SMAC, you could run `bash install_sc2.sh`. Or you could install them manually to other path you like, following the official link: https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.
2. enter the `./sc2/` folder.
3. set hyper-parameters in `run_madt_sc2.py` line 19-49 according to appendix.
4. select a maps to test in `envs/config.py` line 142
5. run the `run_madt_sc2.py` script
'python3 sc2/run_madt_sc2.py'
